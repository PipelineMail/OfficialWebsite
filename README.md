## Foreword
*[A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html):*
>"Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by 
 those for whom I intend it. If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy."

## Problem
In the past few decades, the mailbox system has brought us great convenience, but it is obvious that there are still many problems with the existing mailbox system.
- Provide personal information. When you sign up for X-mail, you have to provide personal information to the X-mail operators. In most cases, this information can be used to determine who you are.

- ***Cleartext transmission,no privacy.*** Emails are sent in clear text without encryption. Although some mailboxes provide the option to send encrypted emails, that's just psychological comfort. In short, you don't have any privacy.

- ***Your are being monitored.*** Mailboxes operators have been providing your mail to governments. Believe it or not, your mails have been monitored in the past and will be monitored in the future. It's common sense.

- ***A flood of spam.*** Since email is basically free to send, anyone who knows your email address can send you an email. This has led to a flood of spam, 
such as advertisements, promotions, etc.

These problems plague us all the time, and these problems are caused by the shortcomings of traditional mailbox design.

## Desiderata
*[A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html):*<br>
> "We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. "

We need to redesign a new mailbox system under a new guiding ideology,And the most important thing is that the new mailbox system must be able to thoroughly protect the privacy of users

## PipeMail
### Introduction
- PipeMail is a decentralized mailbox system. 
- PipeMail pursues Cypherpunk and is committed to protecting the privacy of users.
- When using XMail to send emails, the body and attachments of the emails will be encrypted. (Attachments will be stored on IPFS)
It should be noted that XMail adopts "encryption on the client side, and then uploads the encrypted data", rather than "the client uploads the original plaintext data, and then encrypts it on the server side".

### Features
- ***No Registration Required.*** If you want to use PipeMail, you don't have to provide any information, all you have to do is connect to your digital wallet.
- ***User Controlled Encryption.*** Mail is encrypted with user's public-key. Anyone else, including PipeMail can't get raw mail data, only encrypted data.
- ***Privacy Is Protected.*** Only the sender and recipient can decrypt the mail, no one can monitor your mails. Your privacy can be completely protected.
- ***Almost No Spam.*** To send a mail with PipeMail, the sender needs to pay for gas. This greatly reduces the amount of spam.
- ***Mail must be stamped.*** Use NFTs as postage stamps, which may greatly increase the liquidity of NFTs.PipeMail combined with NFT will bring you an unprecedented web3 experience.

### Target-User

- ***Web3 User:*** If you are a web3 user, maybe you need a mail software for communication, preferably a web3 email software.
- ***Dapp operator:*** If you are a dapp operator, maybe you need a web3-style communication software to communicate with your users.
- ***You:*** PipeMail is for anyone. If you want to protect your privacy, PipeMail is probably one of the best mail software.

## Schedule
- PipeMail is being tested on the test network, and the complete test is expected to be around March 20, when it will be officially launched on the main network.
- Additionally, we have charted the roadmap for the next few releases. After several iterations of these versions, PipeMail will have all the functions of the current mailbox software.

> "We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any."

Joining PipeMail will be a meaningful attempt to defend your privacy.
In other words, helping us means that you, like Assange and Snowden, are fighting for the public's right to privacy.
